This website was a final project for COS 398 - Prof Ethics & Soc Impact Comp (2022 Fall).

I chose this project because I think it is a great way to exemplify how important
confidentiality is, as well as bring light to how confidentiality applies to almost everything we do
in our lives. Confidentiality is incredibly salient in todayâ€™s day and age and it is only getting
more and more complicated. I find that this is a great way to get people thinking about their
privacy as well as the ethics of their privacy. I think that people tend to underestimate the amount
of information that is kept on them, especially information that they would not want released to
the public, so this project would be a fantastic avenue in which I can inform whoever may
stumble upon the website.

This website's goal is to convey some of my learnings throughout the course by describing 
some in-depth knowledge on my chosen topic of confidentiality and privacy.
