          <h1>What is Confidentiality?</h1>
          <p>To put it simply, confidentiality refers to the principle or practice of keeping private information private, unless the owner of the information has specified otherwise. Some examples of private information include but are not limited to: home address, credit card information, phone number, health information, passwords, social security number, gender, location, salary, and bank account numbers. For instance, you wouldnâ€™t want your doctor posting all the details of your last check-up on the internet because that is private information and you trusted your doctor to keep it private. Information like this is typically collected by companies or organizations which require the information to be able to provide you with whatever service they provide. It is thus salient that these companies have the proper infrastructure to handle confidential information and make sure that the users data is held securely. Not only can legal issues arise if user information, especially private information is mishandled, but it is an ethical issue as the user only consented to giving the information to the specific company/organization. Luckily for users, there are a plethora of regulations that companies that collect data must follow such as FIPPS (covering data collection more broadly) and HIPPA (for health information).
          </p>
          <h2>How do companies deal with the issue of confidentiality?</h2>
          <p>
            Most companies use the regulations laid out by various organizations such as those laid out by the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) to build their own confidentiality policies around. This way companies can ensure compliance. Part of these compliance policies include disclosing how data is used to the user, asking for user consent in the collection of private data, and how the company will respond to a breach in security. It is important to note that hacks and breaches in user data are inevitable which is why a proper plan for dealing with breaches in data is necessary. Another important piece of ensuring that a company handles confidential data properly is ensuring that everyone in the company is aware of the company's confidentiality policies, as this will prevent employee confusion over confidentiality.
