            <h1>Confidentiality and Privacy</h1>
            <p> With the ever increasing technology industry continuing to thrive and grow expeditiously, technology is moving towards automation to make our lives easier. At the end of the day, most of our technology is designed to make our lives easier or more enjoyable. Today’s breakthroughs in technology typically involve methods of machine learning and there’s definitely no shortage of automation/machine learning that can be implemented in our lives. Whether it be through a social media app such as TikTok recommending you a video, a music streaming app such as Spotify recommending you a song or artist you might like, or a search engine like Google trying to finish your query, all of these services have something in common. Their collection and need for data. So what they need a little data? This continued breakthrough in technology is great right? I mean, Spotify knows my music taste so well! Well, not so fast. 
            </p>
            <p>All of these different services, products, etc., need some data in order to properly function and this data comes, in almost all cases, directly from the user. Data collected can range from your favorite song or your daily routine based on when you access your computer, to where you live or your credit card information. Now as long as this gathering of data is consensual and the data is safely secured away from others who could misuse the data, there is no problem. Sadly, things are not exactly this easy. The corporations/businesses behind the services we use often collect pieces of our data that most don’t even realize is being collected. Even if these corporations and businesses truly only collected the data that they needed and that we consented to, discarding the data that they no longer need, it’s practically impossible to keep our data fully secure. As technology continues to develop and security practices continue to improve so does the technology and methods of hackers making confidentiality incredibly important.
