          <h1>In what ways am I affected?</h1>
          <p>Confidentiality is incredibly salient in today’s day and age and it is only getting more and more complicated. Not only are companies asking for more information (sometimes justified, sometimes not) but storing this information in a secure way is also getting increasingly more difficult. Anytime you input your personal information into an app, website, etc., you put yourself at risk for having your information, whether private or not, misused (such as having the company sell your data/information to another company) or compromised (such as by a hacker in a data breach). In some cases you may not even be directly giving your information up or are unaware that your information is being gathered. For instance, when browsing the internet on search engines like Google, your searches are being stored and a profile about you and your searches are being made. This is just the tip of the iceberg, you’d be absolutely awestruck to see how much information these various companies (and the government) gather from you, and know about you.

          <h2>What can I do?</h2>

          <p>
            Thankfully, there are ways to minimize the risk of having your confidential data breached, misused, or gathered without your consent. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1. Only provide sensitive information when absolutely necessary:</b> <br>
            This is definitely the most effective way you can protect your privacy, as if they do not get access to your information, it cannot be mishandled or accessed by others. In general, this is good practice, however, it is not always possible to refrain from providing sensitive information, which is why the other methods are useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Make sure you understand what data is being collected: <br></b>
            Knowing exactly what kind of information is being collected about you as well as how the information is being used, is also a good way to minimize the risk of having your confidential data breached, misused, or gathered without your consent. This often will require some research, however, it will give you a much better understanding of what kind of data will be collected from you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3. Search for alternative apps/services that have better data policies or allow for more privacy: </b><br>
            Oftentimes there are alternative apps or services that provide the same function as the app or service that you intend to use but are either more transparent with their data collection, or do not require as much data. For instance, in the realm of web browsers, if privacy is a priority one can opt for a web browser such as Brave that is privacy focused (for instance by blocking advertisements and website trackers) instead of the more popular web browsers like Google Chrome.
